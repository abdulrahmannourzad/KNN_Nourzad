### Prediction of Breast Cancer with KNN Algorithm using python
**KNN Algorithm:**
- The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a supervised machine learning method employed to tackle **classification** and **regression** problems.
- In this algorithm, we calculate the distance between test features with the prediction data under training, and then based on them, we consider a prediction value for the test.
- There are various formulas and techniques to calculate the distance between data. The most important of them are the following:
  - Manhattan Distance
  - Euclidean Distance
  - Minkowski Distance
